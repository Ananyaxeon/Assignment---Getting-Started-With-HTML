The purpose of comments in Html ?
-> Comments are useful when we want to write something about the code but we do not want to run that
or show in the output.Comments are basically for humans, we write comments for our future or for other developers who
might work on the same codebase.
HTML comments serve various purposes, including:
1. Documentation: Developers often use comments to explain the purpose or functionality of certain code
blocks, making it easier for themselves or others to understand the codebase.
2. Debugging: Comments can help in troubleshooting or temporarily disabling sections of code for testing
purposes without deleting them.
3. Reminder: Comments can act as reminders for future modifications or improvements to the code.
4. Work in progress: Comments can mark unfinished sections or indicate that certain code is under
development.
