What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML ?
<!DOCTYPE html>: We start the file with '<!DOCTYPE html>'. It tells the browser what type of document to
expect; in this case it is an HTML document.

* The <DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages
correctly.
* It must appear only once, at the top of the page(before HTML tag).
* The <DOCTYPE> declaration is not case sensitive. We can write any of the following, it does not give any
error.
